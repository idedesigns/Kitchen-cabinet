Bohemian bedrooms are all about eclectic style, so while you might favor a country feel, adding soft furnishings and accessories with clashing styles and unusual colors can work wonders. Boho bedrooms look great with a lighter shade on the walls, like white or cream. Maintain a neutral sofa and blend the tapestry’s colors into whatever throw pillows you choose for the room. In a bedroom this can be used to draw the eye to the bed or to look like a headboard if your bed doesn’t have one.
