A kitchen cabinet helps organise all the knives, forks, plates and other kitchenware that lay stacked, messing up the kitchen. Open floor plans have become a common trend, and the placement of your cabinets will reflect whether you decide to follow this. Materials like silk, velvet, and leather are staples in traditional design. Kitchen cabinet designs play an important role in providing support and a safe storage space for delicate appliances and fragile crockery.
