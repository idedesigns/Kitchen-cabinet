Holiday Cookie Decorating for Kids (Ages 5&#43;) From peachtree-station.com
Before you bake the cookies, use a straw to punch a hole in the dough (this is where you’ll thread the ribbon for hanging). Smaller numbers, like 1 through 5, are great for tiny lines and fine details, while larger numbers, like 6 through 10, are good for thicker outlines and flooding. If your melted chocolate isn&#39;t deep enough to dip the cookies straight down, you can dip the fronts and the backs separately by rotating the cookie towards and away from you. For a special effect, coat with chopped nuts, sprinkles or crushed candies.
