Brush the edges of the pool the night before vacuuming to remove debris, then vacuum the pool in the morning before anyone uses it. A large pool brush makes quick work of the job, but you may need a smaller brush to clean corners. Take the free end of the vacuum hose and hold it in front of the water return outlet to fill it with water. Of these three pool cleaning methods, a manual vacuum is the most economical but it requires the most time and energy.
