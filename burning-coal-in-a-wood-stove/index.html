<p>Coal burns at high temperatures and with great intensity, which could damage the lining of your stove over time. You can burn chunk wood. The wood burns well in the ash bed, so there will be a flat base under the wood stove firebox that allows the ash to build up in the fire. It is not recommended to burn coal in a wood stove, but make sure to use small pieces if you are determined. Clarke 6910101 Barrel II Black Cast Iron Wood &amp; Coal.</p>

<p>Make sure your stove is a multifuel stove. The most efficient way to burn coal in a wood stove is by using a grate to place the coal on top of the burning wood and allowing air to pass underneath. Coal ignites at a temperature more than 100 degrees higher than wood, and it requires a hot bed of wood coals to get it started. To burn efficiently, coal needs a source of air from a grate below the fire, which a wood stove does not have. Burning coal in wood stove.</p>

<p>What kind of coal stove you got anyway? Coal needs a source of air from below the fire to burn efficiently, and so there needs to be a grate at the bottom of the stove which wood burning stoves won’t have. In wood heat’s infancy, we ingenuously equated the heating value of one cord of wood to a 200 gallon tank of #2 fuel oil or a ton of coal.

<p>Make sure that is has a grate. It is not illegal to use your open fireplace or stove in england unless you usually burn house coal in a smoke control area.we urge those concerned to contact their local environmental health department for more information about smoke control areas.alternatively, telephone or email the solid fuel association who can advise on fuels and appliances that can be used in smoke. Also inspect the grates upon which the coal sits after using coal once to see if they have handled it alright.

<p>This will allow the coal time to ignite properly and slowly burn until it turns into embers. Wood needs to burn on a flat bed of ash with sufficient access to air from above the wood.
